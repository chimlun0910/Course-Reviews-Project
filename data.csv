Udemy,Machine Learning A-Z (Python & R in Data Science Course) | Udemy,Shaun R.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"Amazing - you emerge from this course with a rock-solid understanding of a whole array of machine learning techniques and tricks, and you have an entire toolkit to apply each of them. Thank you to both Kirill and Hadelin for a truly inspiring course, I am ready to take on ML with vigor!"
Udemy,Machine Learning A-Z (Python & R in Data Science Course) | Udemy,Ramgopal P.,Rating: 4.5 out of 5,it was really wonderful journey with these courses and it's simple and great explanations on concepts and practical steps. Thank you very much
Udemy,Machine Learning A-Z (Python & R in Data Science Course) | Udemy,Lucas Moreira M.,Rating: 4.5 out of 5,"I have done other courses on machine learning/data science, and this is definitively one of the best, and even better, it is faster than much of the others."
Udemy,Machine Learning A-Z (Python & R in Data Science Course) | Udemy,Shounak Laxman Y.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"Its the best course at this price point, the templates are given and they are explained in depth everything in this is what is expected and more."
Udemy,Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023 | Udemy,Oscar Eduardo G.,Rating: 4.5 out of 5,It's a good course to learn the basics with lots of praticing and projects to better understand the concepts.
Udemy,Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023 | Udemy,Jinfeng C.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"I have to say it takes me a lot of time to merely finish the course. It covers a whole bunch of topics related to real world work scenarios apart from the hard skills that needed in data science or machine learning field. I like the way daniel teaching things by repetition of chunks of codes (this is how we learn new tricks) and writing things out before actually coding. I learned a lot from this course and still need time to congest them. This course will lay a good fundation for someone who want dip more into data scientist career, but if you want to know the mathematical principles behind the algorithms such as random forest, neural networks, you'll have to go and study by yourself.  Generally speaking, this course is excellent stepstone for more advanced or real life data science."
Udemy,Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023 | Udemy,Ghulam D.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,A great experience. I started programming in 2018 but not found a path that makes me a successful programmer. This course provides me the path to work on a single skill and become a programmer. Thanks
Udemy,Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023 | Udemy,Opeyemi O.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,This has really been the best teaching so far. I would love to build a career in data enginerring.
Udemy,"Learn Python for Data Science, Structures, Algorithms, Interviews | Udemy",Enrique B.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,"Jos√© is one of the best teachers. This course is awesome, full packet with a lot of information. I'll need several rounds of it to digest all the material."
Udemy,"Learn Python for Data Science, Structures, Algorithms, Interviews | Udemy",James G.,Rating: 5.0 out of 5,This was best Udemy course I have ever taken!  I thought Mr. Portilla did a great job of explaining things and used wonderful examples to convey the message!  I highly recommend this course for anyone looking to increase their data science skills using Python and Python related Packages / Libraries.
Udemy,"Learn Python for Data Science, Structures, Algorithms, Interviews | Udemy",LUCAS M.,Rating: 4.0 out of 5,"If you're looking for a starter course that will take you by hand and ""help you cross the street"" step by step, this course is for you."
Udemy,"Learn Python for Data Science, Structures, Algorithms, Interviews | Udemy",Brian C.,Rating: 4.0 out of 5,"Great course to learn programming for DS/ML. Students should have a background in Data Science before starting.  My only recommendation is that the instructors would add a lecture or two to tie together all the disparate concepts: KNN, SVM, PCA, NLP, etc."
